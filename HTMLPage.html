            <li>What is the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements? Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language. Semantic elements = elements with meaning. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.</li>
            <li>Why do we prefer using semantic elements? Because they are understandable</li>
            <li>Do all browsers support all of the newest HTML / CSS elements? Not, but most of them</li> 
            <li>Test the following elements on Can I Use: svg, nav, code, form, datalist. Which browser version support them and which do not?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>SVG is a vector graphic formatâ€”based on XML and is used to display a variety of graphics on the Web and other environments. Under the hood, SVG documents are nothing more than simple plain text files that describe lines, curves, shapes, colors, and text. For all Browsers</li>
                    <li>HTML "nav" Tag. The "nav" tag is one of the HTML5 elements. It is used to specify a block of navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Examples of navigation blocks are tables of contents, menus, and indexes.</li>
                    <li>The "code" tag is used to insert variables, fragments of program code, etc. into an HTML document. In the browser, the code is displayed in a monospaced font (a font in which all characters have the same width) of the smaller size. The "code" tag alone represents a single code line or code phrase.</li>
                    <li>The HTML "form" tag is used for creating a form for user input. A form can contain textfields, checkboxes, radio-buttons and more. Forms are used to pass user-data to a specified URL. For all Browsers</li>
                    <li>The "datalist" element specifies a set of pre-defined options for an "input" element. It can be used to provide the quick choices for an input field like an "autocomplete" feature. ... The list attribute of the input element is used to bind it together with a datalist element.
